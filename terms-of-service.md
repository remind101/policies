## Terms of use

Welcome to Remind. Remind is a messaging platform that helps educators, students, parents and other users send quick, simple messages to any device. Please continue reading to learn about the rules and restrictions that govern your use of Remind's website(s) and all other products, services and applications made available by Remind from time to time (collectively, the "Services"). This Agreement includes the terms in this document, as well as Remind's [Privacy Policy](https://www.remind.com/privacy-policy), [Copyright Dispute Policy](https://d3ttu1jszawzcc.cloudfront.net/marketing/pdfs/remind-copyright-dispute-policy.pdf), and the [Apple Application Terms](https://developer.apple.com/terms/).

#### What this is saying

Before using Remind, you need to be at least 18 years old and agree to these terms. If you're under 18, a parent or guardian needs to review and agree to these terms for you.

---

## Will these terms ever change?

We constantly try to improve our Services, so we may update this Agreement as we offer new and improved Services. We may modify this Agreement at any time, but we will do our best to bring this to your attention by posting a notice on the Services or notifying you by email or by some other means. If you don't agree with the new terms, you may reject them but unfortunately you will no longer be able to use the Services. Your use of the Services in any way following notification by Remind constitutes your acceptance of the terms and conditions as modified. We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features, impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services at any time. We'll provide you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely affect you.

You represent and warrant to Remind that:

*   you are at least 18 years old (or, if you are not at least 18 years old, you have your parent's permission to use the Services, and your parent has read and agrees to this Agreement on your behalf);
*   all registration information you submit is accurate and truthful;
*   you will maintain the accuracy of such information;
*   if you're agreeing to this Agreement on behalf of an organization or entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to agree to this Agreement on the organization or entity's behalf and bind them to this Agreement (in which case, the references to "you" and "your" in these Terms, except for in this sentence, refer to that organization or entity). You also certify that you are legally permitted to use and access the Services and take full responsibility for the selection, use of, and access to the Services, including ensuring that you have permission to communicate with anyone you choose to interact with through the Services.
*   if you will be submitting any personal information of a third party to the Services, you represent and warrant that you have obtained consent from such third party to collect, use and disclose to Remind such personal information.

This Agreement is void where prohibited by law, and the right to access the Services is revoked in such jurisdictions.

#### What this is saying

We work hard to improve the Remind experience for you, so our terms may change from time to time. We will update you when we make significant changes. Before continuing to use Remind, it will be important to review and agree to any changes.

## Privacy

We take the privacy of our users very seriously. Please read our Privacy Policy, located at [remind.com/privacy-policy](https://www.remind.com/privacy-policy). Residents of the European Union may read about our additional commitments concerning your privacy by reviewing our pledges as a signatory to the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield agreements [remind.com/privacy-policy#privacy-shield](https://www.remind.com/privacy-policy#privacy-shield) and how Remind complies with the requirements of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation [remind.com/privacy-policy#gdpr](https://www.remind.com/privacy-policy#gdpr).

#### What this is saying

Another important document to look at is our [Privacy Policy](https://www.remind.com/privacy-policy), which outlines what personal information Remind collects from you and how we use that information to provide our service. We take extra steps to be able to lawfully transfer the Personal Data of EU residents to the US and to comply with the EU's privacy regulation.

---

## Use by children

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") requires that online service providers notify parents of children in the United States and obtain their consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13. **Remind only collects personal information through the Services from a child under 13 where that student's school, district and/or teacher has agreed, via the terms described below, to obtain parental consent for that child to use the Services and disclose that personal information to Remind.** Except as expressly set forth below, we do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from a child under 13. Remind's mechanisms and policies for compliance with COPPA meet or exceed the requirements of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation for the protection of the Personal Data of children.

*   For children under 13 we may collect a child's name (first name and last initial), date of birth, email address or telephone number, and the child's parent's email address. We collect these in order to notify the parent that we may contact the child for the purpose of providing the Services for which the child's teacher, Organizer (as described below) or school administrator has signed up to use. Note that if the Remind account of a child under 13 is inactive for at least twelve months (meaning, that account has not received a message through the Remind Services in that time), Remind's policy is to delete the personally-identifiable information associated with that child's account. While we delete the account in these situations, some of the child's data may persist in the files of Remind's agents or service providers for some period of time until it is removed from their systems as well.
*   We may collect personal information through the Services from a child under 13 but only in support of the learning environment. For Remind to collect this type of personal information, a student's school, district or teacher must agree to obtain parental consent for that child to use the Services. The student's school, district or teacher may disclose that personal information to us for a legitimate educational interest.
    *   If you are a school, district, or teacher, you represent and warrant that you are solely responsible for complying with COPPA, meaning you must obtain consent from all parents or guardians whose children under 13 will be accessing the Services. If you are a teacher, you represent and warrant that you are authorized by your school or district to use the Services. You also represent and warrant that you are entering into these Terms on behalf of your school or district. For more information on COPPA, please [click here](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/complying-coppa-frequently-asked-questions).
    *   If you are a school, district, or teacher providing consent on behalf of parents or guardians, you may be required to provide adequate school credentials and a valid school email address to verify your identity.

If we learn we have collected personal information from a student under 13 other than pursuant to the above, or if we learn a student under 13 has provided us personal information beyond what we request from him or her, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a student under 13 may have provided us personal information in violation of this paragraph, please contact us at [rmd.me/help](https://help.remind.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

#### What this is saying

Remind cares about children's privacy, and complies with COPPA, a law created to protect the privacy of minors. We collect limited information for under-13 users and only if we have parental consent. If we don't have consent from a parent or guardian, we delete the information. If you are a teacher or a school providing consent on behalf of parents, you are also responsible for complying with COPPA. You can [learn more here](http://www.business.ftc.gov/documents/0493-Complying-with-COPPA-Frequently-Asked-Questions).

## Fees and payment; Responsibility for usage charges

Access to and use of Remind itself is free, but we do offer additional features that require fees. Remind reserves the right to charge fees for certain features. We will notify you when we intend to charge for a service or feature. You will always have the choice whether to use those features. If you continue to use any service or feature after you have been notified of any applicable fees, that use constitutes your acceptance of any new or increased fees.

Through Remind, you may be able to access and use products or services operated by other individuals or companies who are not employed or controlled by Remind (such as, a payment platform to request and/or make payments). If you use any of these products or services, you must review and agree to the additional terms and conditions and privacy policy, as well as pay any applicable fees required to use those products. Any information you agree to provide will be governed by that business' privacy policy.

Note that, by using the Services, you may receive e-mail or text messages on your phone or mobile device, which may cause you to incur usage charges or other fees or costs in accordance with your wireless or data service plan. Any and all such charges, fees, or costs are your sole responsibility. You should consult with your wireless carrier to determine what rates, charges, fees, or costs may apply to your use of the Services.

Additionally, we have created additional Plans for individuals, schools and districts that want additional features. You may learn about the School and District Plans here: [remind.com/plans](https://www.remind.com/plans).

#### What this is saying

Remind's basic service is free right now, and we have no plans to charge users for the basic service. We will charge fees to those individuals who select our  Individual Plans, or those schools or districts that sign contracts to purchase our School or District Plans. You may choose to use and pay for additional products and services that we or our partners offer. We'll make it clear when fees are added to Remind. We promise :)

---

## Additional terms

This Agreement applies to all users of our Services, but there are special terms for you depending on what type of user you are and whether you use the service for free, as do the vast majority of our users, or pay for use of Remind.

If you are, for example, a student, teammate or parent who is invited to be or added as a member of a class or group by an Organizer, you are a **Participant**. If you are a staff member of a school or school district that has purchased a paid School or District Plan, and have been given administrative rights, then you are a Verified Administrator. If you are a teacher, coach or parent who creates a "class" or "group" of members, then you are an **Organizer**. If you are agreeing to this Agreement on behalf of an organization, such as a school or school district, club, or team, you are an **Organization**. You may not sign up for or use the Services as someone you are not; Remind may disable or terminate your account if you do so. Please read on below to find out what additional terms apply to you.

*   If you are a **Participant** (such as a student, parent, or other individual invited to join a class or group by an Organizer):
    *   You must get your parent or guardian to read and agree to this Agreement before using the Services if you are younger than 18.
    *   You will only join schools, classes and/or groups to which you have been invited, or to which you belong.
    *   In certain cases, you may be invited to join a class or group by another Participant who is already a member of that class or group.
    *   The Organizer and other Participants of your class or group may be able to view information (including your personally identifiable information but not personal contact information), as well as your User Submissions (defined below).
    *   If you are connected to an Organization that has purchased a Plan from Remind,  **Verified Administrators** of the Organization will be able to see and edit your contact information. Verified Administrators may be able to add, remove, and/or move you from classes or groups within the same Organization.
*   If you are accessing the Services as an **Organizer** (such as a teacher, administrator, parent or other adult creating a class or group) and inviting users to join as Participants:
    *   The Services may allow you to invite users to join and/or to add users to your class(s) and/or group(s).
    *   You can invite Participants and other Organizers to your class or group by distributing "class codes" or "group codes", and communicate with those users, (in some cases, there may be more than one Organizer per class/group).
    *   You may only share class or group codes with Participants and Organizers whom you wish to subscribe to your class/group. If you plan to broadly or publicly publish these codes, you must manage the accuracy of your subscriber lists carefully.
    *   It's your responsibility to maintain and monitor the accuracy of the list of Participants for each of your classes or groups.
    *   If you are connected to an Organization on a Remind Plan you may receive additional privileges from a Verified Administrator of your Organization. These privileges may include access to information and User Submissions (defined below) (including personally identifiable information but not personal contact information) of Participants and other Organizers in your class, group or affiliated Organization.
    *   If you are connected to an Organization on a Remind Plan, Verified Administrators of that Organization may be able to join or message members of your class or group, add or update information in your Remind account profile, add, move or remove you from classes or groups affiliated with the Organization, and/or take other actions relating to your access and use of the Services through the Organization.
*   If you are an **Organization** (such as a school, school district or club):
    *   You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the information relating to your Organization. If at any time you learn that a user of the Services claims to be affiliated with your organization but is not, in fact, affiliated with your Organization, or of any other inaccuracy relating to your Organization's information, you will remove that user from your Organization and, if appropiate, notify Remind immediately by visiting [rmd.me/help](https://help.remind.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
*   If Remind verifies you as a Verified Administrator of your Organization, you may have the ability to perform the following tasks:
    *   invite and add Organizers and Participants to the Services,
        *   view and manage users and information affiliated with your Organization,
    *   add, move, or remove Organizers and Participants from classes and/or groups affiliated with your Organization,
    *   connect and upload or sync information relating to Organizers, Participants, classes and/or groups using a data upload or syncing mechanism (such as, using CSV upload or through integration with your School Information Systems (SIS)),
    *   join classes and groups created by Organizers affiliated with your Organization,
    *   communicate directly with other users affiliated with your Organization,
    *   access and manage information and User Submissions, and
    *   view the contact information, which will include personally identifiable information, of all Remind users connected with your school or district, as appropriate, and see which of those users received communications from your school or district.
    *   IF YOU CHOOSE TO DO ANY OF THE ABOVE, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE ALL RIGHTS AND HAVE OBTAINED ALL CONSENTS AND AUTHORIZATIONS NECESSARY TO PERFORM SUCH TASKS AND THAT YOU WILL ONLY USE PERSONAL INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE PRIVACY LAWS.
    *   Remind may use the information you upload to the Services in order to verify Organizers' and Participants' affiliations and otherwise to help us provide you with the Services.
*   With respect to all users of Remind, whether you are a Participant, Organizer or Organization or Verified Administrator:
    *   IF YOU INVITE OR ADD ANYONE TO USE REMIND AND/OR USE ANY FEATURE OF THE SERVICES WHICH REQUIRES SHARING PERSONAL INFORMATION OF ANYONE (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IF YOU IMPORT CONTACTS FROM YOUR ADDRESS BOOK TO THE SERVICES), YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE OBTAINED FREELY GIVEN, INFORMED CONSENT FROM EACH PERSON TO:
        *   RECEIVE SUCH INVITATION AND BE ADDED TO THE SERVICES;
        *   RECEIVE MESSAGES FROM
            *   REMIND,
            *   OTHER PARTICIPANTS OF THE CLASS OR GROUP,
            *   OTHERS WHO HAVE ACCESS TO YOUR CLASS OR GROUP (SUCH AS ORGANIZERS AND VERIFIED ADMINISTRATORS); AND
        *   PROVIDE THAT PERSON'S PERSONAL INFORMATION TO REMIND.

#### What this is saying

You have different rights and responsibilities depending on what type of user you are - Organizer, Participant, Organization or Verified Administrator. In all cases, you need consent from every person you wish to add, invite, or send messages to via Remind.

---

## Registration and security

As a condition to using Services, you may be required to register with Remind by selecting a password and providing your name and a valid email address. You will provide Remind with accurate, complete, and updated registration information. You may not:

*   select or use the name or email of another person with the intent to impersonate that person; or
*   use a name subject to any rights of any person other than you without appropriate authorization.

Remind reserves the right to refuse registration of or to cancel a Remind account in its sole discretion. You will be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password. You may not transfer your account to anyone without express prior written consent of Remind. Violation of any of the foregoing may result in immediate termination of your account, revocation of your ability to use the Services, and may subject you to state and federal penalties and other legal consequences. Remind reserves the right, but will have no obligation, to investigate your use of the Services in order to determine whether a violation of the Agreement has occurred or to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request.

#### What this is saying

The security of your account is very important to us. Please keep your password safe, use your real name and create your own account before using Remind.

---

## Consent to receive periodic messages

As part of the Services, you will receive communications through the Services, including messages that Remind sends you (for example, via SMS, emails, and push notifications). When an Organizer adds a new Participant to a class or group, that Participant will receive a welcome message, instructions on how to stop receiving messages, and information on how to avoid certain charges by downloading the Remind application. Remind may inform Participants who have not replied that they will automatically be removed from the class or group. Remind may also send other administrative messages. BY SIGNING UP FOR THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO RECEIVE COMMUNICATIONS FROM REMIND AS WELL AS CLASS OR GROUP ORGANIZERS AND PARTICIPANTS, AND YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT EACH PERSON YOU INVITE AND/OR ADD HAS CONSENTED TO RECEIVE COMMUNICATIONS FROM YOU AND REMIND. If you connect to or use any third party services in conjunction with Remind, you acknowledge and consent to receive notifications and messages from those third party services. You agree to indemnify and hold Remind harmless for and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses and expenses (including attorneys' fees) arising from or in any way related to your breach of the foregoing.

To permanently cease receiving SMS text messages, please text @STOPALL:

*   in reply to any SMS message from that class or group,
*   to a Remind long-code (a phone number issued by Remind), or
*   in the US, to the Remind short code 81010.

For more information see this [link](https://www.remind.com/support/text).

If you are located in Canada, you may opt out of receiving marketing messages (including text messages and emails); however, you may still receive text message and email communications that are necessary for the Services or otherwise exempt from anti-spam laws.

#### What this is saying

We're letting you know that you may periodically receive messages from us in addition to other Remind users. It's important that you get prior consent from everyone you invite or add to Remind. We've provided instructions on how to easily unsubscribe and stop receiving messages.

---

## Consent to receive emergency messages

As part of the Services you may receive communications through the Services in the event of an emergency, through SMS (text messages), emails, push notifications, or phone call. An emergency meriting a message shall be determined solely by your teacher, organizer, school or district or any official designated by a school or district, or a government agency.  BY SIGNING UP FOR THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO RECEIVE EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS FROM REMIND WHENEVER IT IS DETERMINED THAT CIRCUMSTANCES MERIT THOSE COMMUNICATIONS. IF YOU ARE A TEACHER, ORGANIZER, VERIFIED ADMINISTRATOR, SCHOOL OR DISTRICT OFFICIAL YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT EACH PERSON YOU INVITE AND/OR ADD HAS CONSENTED TO RECEIVE COMMUNICATIONS FROM YOU AND REMIND. If you connect to or use any third party services in conjunction with Remind, you acknowledge and consent to receive notifications and messages from those third party services. Because Remind does not control whether to send or not send an emergency notification, Remind is never responsible for your receipt of, or failure to receive an emergency message. Often when an emergency is suspected the individuals empowered to determine whether to send an emergency message through Remind may have incorrect or only partial information. Remind is not responsible for messages sent erroneously or for the content of any message sent as an emergency message, even when the content of that message contains information that is incomplete, confusing, or erroneous.  YOU ALONE CAN DETERMINE WHAT, IF ANY, ACTIONS TO TAKE IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY OR IN RESPONSE TO AN EMERGENCY MESSAGE YOU RECEIVE THROUGH REMIND. YOU AGREE TO INDEMNIFY AND HOLD REMIND HARMLESS FOR AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, LIABILITIES, DAMAGES (ACTUAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL), LOSSES AND EXPENSES (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS' FEES) ARISING FROM OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO YOUR RECEIPT OF EMERGENCY MESSAGES OR YOUR FAILURE TO RECEIVE AN EMERGENCY MESSAGE.While we strongly encourage you not to, you may opt out of receiving emergency messages as SMS text messages or emails, but not phone calls. To permanently cease receiving SMS text messages, please text @STOPALL:

*   in reply to any SMS message from that class or group,
*   to a Remind long-code (a phone number issued by Remind), or
*   in the US, to the Remind short code 81010.

For more information see this [link](https://www.remind.com/support/text).

If the authorized administrator at your school or district is sharing information from the School Information System with Remind, you will receive emergency messages as phone calls to the phone number you have on record with your school or district. You will receive these phone calls even if you opt out of receiving SMS text messages on Remind. You can opt out of receiving these phone calls only by having the authorized administrator at your school or district remove your contact information from their School Information System.

#### What this is saying

We are letting you know that in the event of an emergency, determined by those individuals in your school, school district, community or a government official and not Remind, you may receive emergency messages from us in addition to other Remind users. While Remind provides schools and districts with the ability to send emergency messages through Remind,  Remind is neither responsible for your receipt of or failure to receive a message, nor your actions, failure to act or the actions or inactions of others in response to any emergency message. We do not want you to opt out of these messages as your schools or district may wish for you to receive an emergency message. However, we provided instructions on how to easily unsubscribe and stop receiving SMS text messages and emails. To stop receiving phone calls, you need to talk to your school or district.

As we explain in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.remind.com/privacy-policy), if Remind knows or becomes aware of a security breach of its users' personally identifiable information, Remind will notify affected users or post a notice on the Services as required by applicable law(s).

#### What this is saying

Be sure to only share content that belongs to you. We may view and/or use content you post on Remind (for example, format a message you send and display it to the recipients)â€”but you still own it.

Also, be sure to read our [Community Guidelines](https://www.remind.com/community-guidelines), which include best practices for how to keep the Remind community safe. We need to work together to ensure Remind is a secure and supportive environment.

## Third party service providers

The Services may contain links to third party websites, products or services that are not owned or controlled by Remind ("Third Party Services"). When you access Third Party Services, you do so at your own risk. Remind encourages you to be aware when you leave the Services and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each Third Party Service that you visit or use.

Remind has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, accuracy, privacy policies, or practices of or opinions expressed in any Third Party Services.

# Remind Terms of Service

_Effective Date: December 30, 2014_

**IMPORTANT - IF YOU ARE UNDER THE AGE OF 18, YOU MUST HAVE YOUR PARENT OR GUARDIAN READ THE AGREEMENT BELOW AND AGREE TO IT FOR YOU. IF YOU DON’T GET YOUR PARENT OR GUARDIAN TO READ AND AGREE TO THIS, YOU DON’T HAVE PERMISSION TO USE THIS SITE. ALWAYS GET AN ADULT’S PERMISSION BEFORE GOING ONLINE.**

**PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE (“AGREEMENT”) CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE SERVICES OFFERED BY REMIND101, INC. (“REMIND” OR “WE” OR “US”). THIS IS A BINDING AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND REMIND. BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICES IN ANY MANNER, YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY AND A PARTY TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL OTHER TERMS. IF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT ARE CONSIDERED AN OFFER, ACCEPTANCE IS EXPRESSLY LIMITED TO SUCH TERMS.

***

## Terms of Use

Welcome to Remind. Please continue reading to learn about the rules and restrictions that govern your use of Remind’s website(s) and all other products, services and applications made available by Remind from time to time (such as, Remind’s iOS and Android mobile applications and the Remind services available on SMS) (collectively, the “Services”). This Agreement includes the terms in this document, as well as Remind’s [Privacy Policy](https://www.remind.com/privacy-policy), Copyright Dispute Policy, and Apple Application Terms.

> WHAT THIS IS SAYING

> Before using Remind, you need to be at least 18 years old, and agree to these terms. If you’re under 18, a parent or guardian needs to agree to these terms for you.

***

## Will these terms ever change?

We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so this Agreement may need to change along with the Services. We reserve the right to modify this Agreement at any time, but we will do our best to bring this to your attention by posting a notice on the Services, sending you a notice via email, and/or by some other means. If you don’t agree with the new terms, you may reject them but unfortunately you will no longer be able to use the Services. Your use of the Services in any way following such notification constitutes your acceptance of the terms and conditions as modified. We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services, at any time. We’ll do our best to provide you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely affect you, but this isn’t always practical.

You represent and warrant to Remind that: (i) you are at least 18 years old (or, if you are not at least 18 years old, you have your parent’s permission to use the Services, and your parent has read and agrees to this Agreement on your behalf); (ii) all registration information you submit is accurate and truthful; (iii) you will maintain the accuracy of such information; (iv) if you’re agreeing to this Agreement on behalf of an organization or entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to agree to this Agreement on that organization or entity’s behalf and bind them to this Agreement (in which case, the references to “you” and “your” in these Terms, except for in this sentence, refer to that organization or entity). You also certify that you are legally permitted to use and access the Services and take full responsibility for the selection and use of and access to the Services. This Agreement is void where prohibited by law, and the right to access the Services is revoked in such jurisdictions.

> WHAT THIS IS SAYING

> We want to continually improve the Remind experience for you, so our terms may change from time to time. We will do everything we reasonably can to update you about these changes ahead of time. Before continuing to use Remind, it will be important to re-review and agree to any changes.

***

## Privacy

We take the privacy of our users very seriously. Please read our Privacy Policy, located at <https://remind.com/privacy-policy>.

> WHAT THIS IS SAYING

> Another important document to look at is our [Privacy Policy](https://www.remind.com/privacy-policy). This outlines what personal information we collect from you and how we use that information to provide the Remind service.

***

## Use by children

The Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that online service providers obtain parental consent or provide notice before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from a child under 13, except in the following circumstances: 

* We may collect a child’s name (first name and last initial), date of birth, email address or telephone number, and the child’s parent’s email address in order to provide notice to parents that we may contact their child for the purpose of providing the Services that their teacher has signed up for. Note that if a child user’s Remind account is inactive for at least twelve months (meaning, that account has not received a message through the Remind Services in that time), Remind’s policy is to delete the personally-identifiable information associated with that child’s account.
* We may collect personal information through the Services from a child under 13 where that student's school, district, and/or teacher has agreed (via the terms described below) to obtain parental consent for that child to use the Services and disclose personal information to us, for the use and benefit of the learning environment. 
   * If you are a school, district, or teacher, you represent and warrant that you are solely responsible for complying with COPPA. For more information on COPPA, please [click here](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/complying-coppa-frequently-asked-questions).
   * If you are a teacher, you represent and warrant that you have permission and authorization from your school and/or district to use the Services, and for purposes of COPPA compliance, you represent and warrant that you are entering into these Terms on behalf of your school and/or district. 
   * As a school, district, or teacher providing consent on behalf of parents or guardians, in order to create an Organizer account (as described below) you may be required to provide valid school credentials and a valid school email address to verify your identity in order to access and use certain features of the Services.

If we learn we have collected personal information from a student under 13 other than pursuant to the above, or if we learn a student under 13 has provided us personal information beyond what we request from him or her, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a student under 13 may have provided us personal information in violation of this paragraph, **please contact us at contact@remind.com**.  

> WHAT THIS IS SAYING

> We care about children’s privacy, and are careful about information collected from students under 13 and how its retained. Remind complies with COPPA, a law created to protect the privacy of minors. You can learn more [here](http://www.business.ftc.gov/documents/0493-Complying-with-COPPA-Frequently-Asked-Questions). If you are a teacher or a school providing consent on behalf of parents, you are also responsible for complying with COPPA.

***

## Fees and payment; Responsibility for usage charges

Access to and use of the Services itself is free, but in the future, we may offer new or additional special features which Remind may charge for. Therefore, Remind reserves the right to require payment of fees for certain Services. If you want access to those Services, you will pay all applicable fees for those Services, as will be described on the Services. If you continue to use those Services following such notification, that use constitutes your acceptance of any new or increased charges.

Note that, by using the Services, you may receive e-mail or text messages on your phone or mobile device, which may cause you to incur usage charges or other fees or costs in accordance with your wireless or data service plan. Any and all such charges, fees, or costs are your sole responsibility. You should consult with your wireless carrier to determine what rates, charges, fees, or costs may apply to your use of the Services.

> WHAT THIS IS SAYING

> Remind is free right now, and has no plans to charge teachers for the basic service. In order to keep the lights on, we may have to eventually add fees. If fees are added in the future, we’ll tell you. We promise :)

***

## Additional terms

This Agreement applies to all users of our Services, but there are special terms for you depending on what type of user you are. If you are, for example, a teacher, coach or parent who organizes a “class” or “group” of members, then you are an **Organizer**. If you are, for example, a student, teammate or parent who is invited to be a member of a class or group by an Organizer, you are a **Subscriber**. In certain cases, Subscribers may be allowed to invite new members to a “group” to become Subscribers. If you are agreeing to this Agreement on behalf of an organization, such as a school or school district, club, or team, you are an **Organization**. You may not sign up for or use the Remind Services as someone you are not; Remind may disable or terminate your account if you do so. _Please read on below to find out what additional terms apply to you._

* If you are a **Subscriber** (such as a student, parent, or other individual invited to join a group by an Organizer):
   * You must get your parent or guardian to read and agree to this Agreement before using the Services if you are under 18.
   * You will only join classes and/or groups that you have been invited to, or based on your school, class or group affiliation, to which you are a part of.

* If you are an **Organization** (such as a school or school district):
   * You will only permit staff members (for example, your teachers) who are current employees of your organization to use the Services and to create their own class or group codes. Upon termination of a staff member’s employment with the Organization, you will require such individual to return and cease using all class or group codes he or she has in his or her possession. If at any time you learn a user of the Services claims to be affiliated with your organization who is not, in fact, affiliated with your Organization, you will notify Remind immediately by emailing contact@remind.com.

* If you are accessing the Services as an **Organizer** (such as a teacher, administrator, or parent creating a group and inviting users to join as Subscribers):
   * The Services may allow you to invite users to join your group(s) and/or to add users to your group(s). IF YOU INVITE OTHER USERS TO JOIN YOUR GROUP, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT TO US THAT YOU HAVE OBTAINED CONSENT FROM EACH PERSON THAT YOU INVITE AND/OR ADD TO RECEIVE SUCH INVITATION AND TO RECEIVE MESSAGES FROM REMIND, FROM YOU, AND FROM ANYONE ELSE IN THE GROUP. 
   * Organizers can invite members by distributing “class codes” or “group codes” and communicate with Subscribers, (in some cases, there may be more than one Organizer per group).
   * You may only share class or group codes with Subscribers whom you wish to subscribe to your group. If you plan to broadly or publicly publish these codes, you must manage the accuracy of your subscriber lists carefully.
   * Organizers must maintain and monitor Subscriber lists in order to help ensure accurate representation of the Subscribers in your group.

> WHAT THIS IS SAYING

> There are different ways to use Remind depending on if you’re a teacher (Organizer), a student/parent (Participant) or an administrator (School). This means that our terms may also be different depending on your role.

***

## Registration and security

As a condition to using Services, you may be required to register with Remind by selecting a password and providing your name and a valid email address. You will provide Remind with accurate, complete, and updated registration information. You may not (i) select or use the name or email of another person with the intent to impersonate that person; or (ii) use a name subject to any rights of any person other than you without appropriate authorization. Remind reserves the right to refuse registration of or cancel a Remind account in its sole discretion. You will be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password. You may not transfer your account to anyone without express prior written consent of Remind. Violation of any of the foregoing may result in immediate termination of your account, revocation of your ability to use the Services, and may subject you to state and federal penalties and other legal consequences. Remind reserves the right, but will have no obligation, to investigate your use of the Services in order to determine whether a violation of the Agreement has occurred or to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request.

> WHAT THIS IS SAYING

> The security of your account is very important to us. Please keep your password safe, use your real name and create your own account before using Remind.

***

## Consent to receive periodic messages from Remind

As part of the Services, Remind may send communications (such as SMS, emails, and push notifications)  to Subscribers of a class group. For example, upon adding a new Subscriber to a class group, such new Subscriber will receive a welcome message, instructions on how to stop receiving messages, and information on how to avoid certain charges by downloading the Remind Application. Remind also may inform Subscribers who have not replied that they automatically will be removed from the class group if they do not reply. Remind may send other administrative messages as well. BY SIGNING UP FOR THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO RECEIVE COMMUNICATIONS FROM REMIND, AND YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT EACH USER YOU INVITE AND/OR ADD TO A GROUP HAS CONSENTED TO RECEIVE COMMUNICATIONS FROM REMIND AS WELL AS FROM YOU AND ANYONE ELSE IN THE GROUP. You agree to indemnify and hold Remind harmless for and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising from or in any way related to your breach of the foregoing.

To permanently cease receiving SMS text messages, please follow the instructions below: 

* If you are located in the **US or Canada**, text STOP, CANCEL, or UNSUBSCRIBE: 
   * in reply to any SMS message from that group,
   * to a Remind long-code (a phone number issued by Remind), or
   * in the US, to the Remind short code 81010. To stop receiving messages from a specific class or group, text UNSUBSCRIBE @class or group code to a Remind long-code (a phone number issued by Remind), or in the US, to the Remind short code 81010.

* If you are an **international user** located anywhere outside of the 50 US states or Canana, please [click here](https://remind101.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202540968-How-do-I-opt-out-of-receiving-messages-) to learn how to unsubscribe from receiving messages.

> WHAT THIS IS SAYING

> We’re letting you know that you may receive messages from us or even from other Remind users periodically. It’s also important that you get consent from any subscribers before inviting them to join your class. It’s easy for you or anyone else to unsubscribe and stop messages, [here’s how](https://remind101.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202540968-How-do-I-opt-out-of-receiving-messages).

## Copyright dispute policy

Under the Digital Millenium Copyright Act (the “DMCA”), online service providers such as Remind have the right, but not the obligation, to remove material that allegedly violates someone’s copyright. We respect others’ intellectual property rights, and we reserve the right to delete or disable Content alleged to be infringing, and to terminate the accounts of repeat alleged infringers.

## Third party websites

The Services may contain links to third party websites that are not owned or controlled by Remind. When you access third party websites, you do so at your own risk. Remind encourages you to be aware when you leave the Services and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third party website that you visit or utilize.

Remind has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, accuracy, privacy policies, or practices of or opinions expressed in any third party websites. In addition, Remind will not and cannot monitor, verify, censor or edit the content of any third party site. By using the Services, you expressly relieve and hold harmless Remind from any and all liability arising from your use of any third party website or service.

Your interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or through the Services, including payment and delivery of goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any of these third parties. You agree that Remind will not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings.

If there is a dispute between users on this site, or between users and any third party, you understand and agree that Remind is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you hereby release Remind, its officers, employees, agents, and successors in rights from claims, demands, and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or our service. If you are a California resident, you will and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”

> WHAT THIS IS SAYING

> Organizers may send links via Remind that take you to other third party services (those are services that aren’t part of Remind, such as YouTube, Google Docs, Flickr etc). We can’t be held responsible for the content of those links or any issues that arise.

Upon termination of your account, your right to use the Services, and any Content will immediately cease; however, Remind may retain messaging data or other data and information pursuant to this Agreement and as necessary for auditing purposes and as required by law.

***

## Choice of law and arbitration

This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to the conflict of laws provisions thereof. Any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement will be finally settled in small claims court or by arbitration in San Francisco, California or in a location that is reasonably convenient for you, using the English language in accordance with the Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who will be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with the Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS. If you cannot afford or otherwise do not want to pay arbitration filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver of fees, we will consider in good faith any request by you for us to bear the cost of those fees. We will pay any administration fee, arbitration fees and fees and charges of attorneys, experts and witnesses if and to the extent we are required to pay such fees and charges by law or in order to make this arbitration provision enforceable. By agreeing to these terms, you acknowledge that you may not participate in a class action in court or in arbitration, either as a class representative, class member or class opponent. ACCORDINGLY, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU MAY NOT HAVE ACCESS TO A COURT (OTHER THAN A SMALL CLAIMS COURT) OR TO A JURY TRIAL. Judgment upon the award so rendered may be entered in a court having jurisdiction, or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party will have the right to institute an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable relief pending a final decision by the arbitrator.

> WHAT THIS IS SAYING

> If there are any disputes regarding your experience on our Service or this agreement, you’re agreeing to arbitration (this means no jury trial or class-action lawsuits) to resolve any issues with Remind.

***

## Miscellaneous

The failure of either party to exercise, in any respect, any right provided for herein will not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. Remind will not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond Remind’s reasonable control, including, without limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation (including “line-noise” interference). If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. This Agreement is not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with Remind’s prior written consent. Remind may transfer, assign or delegate this Agreement and its rights and obligations without consent. Both parties agree that this Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, and that all modifications must be in a writing signed by both parties, except as otherwise provided herein. This Agreement and any subsequent versions of this Agreement posted to the Services will be deemed a writing signed by both parties. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of this Agreement and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Remind in any way whatsoever.

> WHAT THIS IS SAYING

> You agree that you will follow these Terms of Service when using Remind. You can’t agree to these terms for anyone else (unless you’re the guardian of a minor under 18). If you have any questions, please reach out to us at contact@remind.com.
